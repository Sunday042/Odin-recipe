    <h3>Ingredient</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>2 cups butter</li>
        <li>4 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 (3 ounce) packages strawberry flavored Jell-O® mix</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3 drops red food coloring</li>
        <li>3 ½ cups boiling water</li>
        <li>¼ cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>3 pounds fresh strawberries, sliced</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups whipped cream, or to taste (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease mini muffin pans.
        </li>

        <li>Place cream cheese and butter in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until smooth and fluffy.
            Gradually beat in
            flour, one cup at a time, until all is incorporated. Roll dough into 70 small balls, and press each into a
            mini muffin
            pan cup to form the pastry crusts.
        </li>

        <li>Bake crusts in preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes. Remove from oven, and allow to cool.

        </li>

        <li>Stir gelatin, sugar, and food coloring into the boiling water. Place over high heat; bring back to a boil.
            Stir together
            cornstarch and water to make a paste. Stir the cornstarch mixture in the boiling gelatin until dissolved.
            Remove from
            heat and allow to cool completely, about 30 minutes.
        </li>


        <li>Spoon cooled gelatin mixture evenly into tart shells. Push a strawberry half down into each tart. If
            desired, top each
            tart with a small amount of whipped cream or whipped topping just before serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
